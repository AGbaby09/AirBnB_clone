#AirBnB clone - The Console 
This project is a clone of an online marketplace and hospitality service that connects travelers with individuals offering accommodations for short-term rental. Founded in 2008, Airbnb has become a global platform with a wide range of listings, including apartments, houses, and unique properties like treehouses and castles. Travelers can search for accommodations based on their preferences and budget, while hosts can earn income by renting out their spaces. Through Airbnb, travelers can enjoy a more personalized and unique travel experience while supporting local hosts and communities around the world.
